Hi all,

For class this week, we'll be discussing model fit and modification in SEM. Please read Kline Ch. 12 and the two chapters on fit and modification posted under Files > Week 8.

Also, in class we'll chat about the upcoming SEM project proposal, due 10/26, so feel free to bring questions about the scope/content of this. I'll also post a formal document about the proposal later this week.

Best,

Michael
