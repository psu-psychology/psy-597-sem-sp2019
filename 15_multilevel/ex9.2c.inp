TITLE:
this is an example of a two-level 
	regression analysis for a continuous 
	dependent variable with a random slope and a latent covariate
DATA:
FILE = "ex9.2c.dat";
 
VARIABLE:
NAMES = y x w clus; 
 MISSING=.;
 BETWEEN = w;
	  CLUSTER = clus;
DEFINE:
CENTER x (GRANDMEAN);
ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
    ESTIMATOR=MLR;
MODEL:

    %WITHIN%	
 	    s | y ON x;		
	  %BETWEEN%	
	    y s ON w x;
	    y WITH s;
