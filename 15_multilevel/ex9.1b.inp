TITLE:
this is an example of a two-level 
	  regression analysis for a continuous 
	  dependent variable with a random intercept and a latent covariate
DATA:
FILE = "ex9.1b.dat";
 
VARIABLE:
NAMES = y x w clus; 
 MISSING=.;
 BETWEEN = w;
	  CLUSTER = clus;
DEFINE:
CENTER x (GRANDMEAN);
ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL;
    ESTIMATOR=MLR;
MODEL:

    %WITHIN%
	    y ON x (gamma10);
	  %BETWEEN%
	    y ON w 
	         x (gamma01);
OUTPUT:
STDYX RESIDUAL;
